arpack: ARPACK (A F77 library for solving large scale eigenvalue problems)
arpack:
arpack: ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric,
arpack: nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant
arpack: application areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k)
arpack: eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest
arpack: real part or largest magnitude.  Storage requirements are on
arpack: the order of n*k locations.  No auxiliary storage is required.
arpack: A set of Schur basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional
arpack: eigen-space is computed which is numerically orthogonal to working
arpack: precision.  Numerically accurate eigenvectors are available
arpack: on request.
